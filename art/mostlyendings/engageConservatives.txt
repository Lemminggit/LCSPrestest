     You are about to engage Conservative forces in battle.
You will find yourself in the Liberal safehouse, and it will
be swarming with Conservative units.  The Liberal Crime
Squad will be located far from the entrance to the safehouse.
It is your task to bring your squad out to safety, or fight
off the Conservatives within the perimeter.  Either way you
choose, any equipment from the safehouse which isn't held by a
Liberal will be scattered about the compound.  Save what
you can.  You might notice your Squad has filled out to
six members if any were available.  If you have a larger pool
of Liberals, they will be traveling behind the Squad.
There is a new button, (R)eorganize, which reflects this.
Squad members in the back with firearms can provide cover
fire.  If you have at least six people total, then six must
be in the Squad.  If less than six, then they all must.
