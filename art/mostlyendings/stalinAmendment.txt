     In recognition of the fact that the proletariat is being exploited
by bourgeoisie faux-leftist liberal elites, WE THE PEOPLE HEREBY
REPEAL THE CONSTITUTION.  The former United States are to be
reorganized into the PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF AMERICA, with new
boundaries to be determined by leading Stalinist philosophers.
#
Josef Stalin is General Secretary and Premier, forever, even after death.
#
The following Politburo Commissars are also chosen in perpetuity:
People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Vyacheslav Molotov
and People's Commissar for Internal Affairs Lavrentiy Beria.
#
In the event of the deaths of any of the aforementioned
persons, though they shall still nominally hold these posts,
actual decisions shall be made by Stalinist Party leaders,
chosen by Stalinist Party loyalists.
#
Anyone attempting to petition for redress of grievances will be sent
to a gulag in newly annexed Canada or, if you're lucky, executed.
#
Have a nice day.
