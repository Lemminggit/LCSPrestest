 tumbles out of the way!
 jumps aside at the last moment!
 leaps for cover!
 ducks back behind cover!
 wisely stays behind cover!
 rolls away from the attack!
 nimbly dodges away from the line of fire!
 leaps over the attack!
 gracefully dives to avoid the attack!
 twists to avoid the attack!
 spins to the side!
 does the Matrix-dodge!
 avoids the attack with no difficulty at all!
 flexes slightly to avoid being hit!
 confidently allows the attack to miss!
 seems to avoid the attack with only an angry glare!
