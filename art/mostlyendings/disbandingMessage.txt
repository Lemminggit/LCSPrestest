Disbanding scatters the Liberal Crime Squad, sending all of its members
into hiding, free to pursue their own lives.  You will be able to observe
the political situation in brief, and wait until a resolution is reached.
#
If at any time you determine that the Liberal Crime Squad will be needed
again, you may return to the homeless shelter to restart the campaign.
#
Do not make this decision lightly.  If you do need to return to action,
only the most devoted of your former members will return.
