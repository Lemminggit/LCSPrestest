     In light of the Conservative nature of entrenched politicians,
and the corrupting influence of incumbency on the democratic process,
all members of the House of Representatives and Senate shall henceforth
be limited to one term in office.  This shall be immediately enforced
by holding elections to replace all members of Congress upon the
ratification of this amendment.
