An elite FBI force conducted simultaneous 
raids on several suspected Conservative Crime Squad safehouses in the early hours. Despite resistance from 
CCS terrorists armed with automatic weapons and body armor, no FBI agents were killed in the raids, and all 
three raids were successful. Seventeen suspects were killed in the fighting, and twenty-three are 
now in custody.

  The Conservative Crime Squad fell on hard times when the alternative newspaper Liberal Guardian published 
1147 pages of documents showing extensive government support for the group. The ensuing scandal 
led to the arrest of twenty-five members of Congress, as well as several leadership figures in the 
Conservative Party's National Committee.

  "I want parents to rest easy tonight," FBI Chief 
Roberta T. Malton said during a news conference to announce the raids.  "You don't need the Liberal Crime Squad 
to protect you. The Government can handle it."
