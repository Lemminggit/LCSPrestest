ACTIVITY_WRITE_LETTERS
===Write to Newspapers===
 Write to Newspapers is a legal activity and form of Liberal Activism that
 boosts the Writing skill and is more effective at influencing Public Opinion
 the higher the Writing skill is. A main reason for writing to newspapers is
 developing enough writing skill to effectively Write for the Liberal Guardian,
 which has a much bigger influence than Write to Newspapers and is still
 completely legal.
 Unlike writing for the Liberal Guardian, writing to other newspapers does not
 require you to own your own newspaper that you set up by deciding to Invest in
 a location and spending lots of money on the one-time fee for starting up your
 own newspaper, plus you can do it from anywhere, and it boosts your Writing
 skill much faster than writing for the Liberal Guardian.
 To have the option to write for the Liberal Guardian, you need to own your own 
 newspaper that you set up by deciding to Invest in a location, by pressing 'Z' 
 on the main screen untill you have an option to invest and spending $3,000 on 
 a Printing Press. Additionally a character must be physically located at that 
 safehouse.
